Born in 1987, Transylvania (Romania), I showed proclivity towards drawing from a young age, copying Rembrandt sketches from a book my grandmother bought me from an antiquarium. I have studied drawing and painting at Barothi Zoltan’s art school during my primary school years. During this time, I have also collaborated with a local artist in creating a comic book series for the school’s newspaper, for which I have done the drawing and colouring. I’ve relocated to London in 2010 to pursue my passion and developing my knowledge of art history, studying different styles and techniques.
Working primarily in oil on canvas, I have also worked on murals with acrylic and on drawings in ink on kraft paper. Most of my work is figurative art, examining the human body in different situations and placing it in surroundings that reverberate the emotional tension. The subconscious mind is a source of inspiration for me and I try to depict that through the body language of my subjects. I aspire to create art that has a timeless quality to it, but which mirrors my understanding of the effects of time and space on the human consciousness in the 21st century. I have been featured in art magazines ('Average art’, ‘A5’,’Art Reveal’) and have works in private collections in US, South America and Europe.
