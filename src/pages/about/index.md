description: >-
  Born in 1987, Transylvania, I showed proclivity towards drawing from
  a young age, copying Rembrandt sketches from a book my grandmother
  bought me from an antiquarium. At that time painting didn’t interest
  me, it seemed too messy and permanent. I don’t mind the mess
  anymore, I make plenty of it in my South London studio and the
  permanence of my work is what drives me to improve my painting
  skills, so my grandmother would be proud of me.
