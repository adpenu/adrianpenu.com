description: >
  The portraits depicted by the artist form a remarkable collection of
  individuals whom influenced history, science, politics and culture in a way
  that is often overlooked and misunderstood. The collection also consists of
  paintings that are more personal to the artist such as a self portrait and a
  depiction of the artist’s father as a student.
